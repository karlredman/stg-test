This project is a response to tests presented to me from a company I 
once interviewed for.

This a package of answers to a few questions that were asked of me for interviewing purposes a couple of years ago. This stuff is pretty basic except the part that asks for an efficient solution on how to count the number of bits in a stream (which doesn't pop up that often in application programming). I provide this code here for my own use as well as a reference for other programmers who have asked me about this kind of stuff (it comes up here and there).

In an attempt to make this test easy to evaluate I went a little crazy
with the programming here. I've enjoyed this test because I was able to 
do some fun programming while trying to prove myself as a proficient 
programmer.  I was privleged to have learned some new stuff too.

This is an automake script driven project that will build itself I have 
only tested this project on Slackware Linux thus far (as of 12-21-2000) 
but it should run on just about anything with a GNU compiler package.  
"make install" has been prohibited in this distrobution.

To run the examples/solutions you can just go to the "./bin" directory
and run the individual programs (ans1, ans2, ans3, and ans3a). 

You will find the code for these programs under the "./src/" directory
structure. "./src/c" containes answers to the first 3 problems while
"./src/cc" containes a bonus proof for the third problem only.

The original email message requesting answers for the solutions 
presented here is also included with this tarball under the "./doc"
directory. The file name is STG_TEST.

Below you will find directions on what we have here and what to do.


if you experience any problems please email me at:

Sincerely,

INSTALLING/MAKING:

1. run "./configure" in this directory

2. run "make"

3. change directory to "./bin" to run the programs

4. review the source code in directories "src/c" and "src/cc".
